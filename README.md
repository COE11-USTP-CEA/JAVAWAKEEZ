Job board webpage

A job board is either a physical or electronic location on which job opportunities are posted. Since most physical boards have gone the way of the dinosaurs, we will focus our discussion on websites that function as electronic job boards on the Internet. Most job boards will post the name of the employer, a brief description of the job, a location, qualifications required for the job, an application deadline and the method of application, which often includes a hypertext link to the employer's online application site. Job boards can be broken up into different categories, such as private or government boards, as well as boards that require a subscription and boards that do not. 

  This webpage allows the employee to search for jobs and the employers to post job hirings. At the same time employers can add and delete jobs.
