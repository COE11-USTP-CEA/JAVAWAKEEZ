Job board webpage

A job board is either a physical or electronic location on which job opportunities are posted. Since most physical boards have gone the way of the dinosaurs, we will focus our discussion on websites that function as electronic job boards on the Internet. Most job boards will post the name of the employer, a brief description of the job, a location, qualifications required for the job, an application deadline and the method of application, which often includes a hypertext link to the employer's online application site. Job boards can be broken up into different categories, such as private or government boards, as well as boards that require a subscription and boards that do not.

Types of Job Boards


Government job boards are job boards run by government entities at the local, state and federal levels. They are free to use. Some government agencies, such as unemployment offices, may post jobs offered by private sector employers. Private job boards fall into two categories: company job boards and public job boards. Company job boards are usually found as a webpage of the company's human resources department and list the jobs currently available with the company. Public job boards, on the other hand, are sort of like the employment section of an old fashioned newspaper. They list jobs available from different public sector and private sector employers. Some public boards are national in scope, and some are regional or local. Some boards may post all types of jobs, while some may focus on a particular profession, such as nursing.


  This webpage allows the employee to search for jobs and the employers to post job hirings. At the same time employers can add and delete jobs.
