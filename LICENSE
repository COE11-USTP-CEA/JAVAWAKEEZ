A software is an organized information in the form of operating systems, utilities, programs, and applications that enable computers to work. Software consists of carefully-organized instructions and code written by programmers in any of various special computer languages. Software is divided commonly into two main categories: (1) System software: controls the basic (and invisible to the user) functions of a computer and comes usually preinstalled with the machine. See also BIOS and Operating System. (2) Application software: handles multitudes of common and specialized tasks a user wants to perform, such as accounting, communicating, data processing, word processing.
